[Storyline]

Our game is named as “Math Maze” which users need to find a way out of the maze and along the journey, users need to solve all the Mathematics questions given. We decide to use the storyline of “The Little Prince” as our main game theme. As we know, the storybook of “The Little Prince” talks about how the little prince that came from planet B612 travel around the planets and searching for the meaning of loneliness, friendship, love and loss. Thus, we take this as our ideas to create maze which serve as the journey where little prince travel around and the player as little prince. Final goal of the users is to collide the B612 planet and find the rose to win the game which same as the goal of little prince go back and find his rose after traveling.
